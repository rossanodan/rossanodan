[Linktree](https://linktr.ee/) is a tool that works as a URLs aggregator. Creating an account, you have access to a simple landing page that can host multiple links (social, website, etc). Its free plan offers a decent amount of features for a basic usage but the most interesting features are available in the [Starter, Pro and Premium plans](https://linktr.ee/s/pricing/).

Here's where [Linkfree](https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/) comes to play.

LinkFree is an open-source alternative to Linktree implemented in JavaScript.
